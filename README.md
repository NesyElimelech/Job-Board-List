To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
 <div className="container m-auto">
        {filters.length > 0 && (
          <div className="flex flex-wrap -my-48 mb-28 md:-my-28 md:mb-16 lg:-my-24 lg:mb-10 mx-12 md:mx-40 p-6 rounded-md justify-between bg-white board relative z-10 ">
            <div className="flex flex-wrap">
              {filters.map((filter) => (
                <div
                  key={filter}
                  className="flex items-center mb-5 md:mb-0 curser-pointer"
                >
                  <span className="tag rounded-md font-bold ">{filter}</span>

                  <span
                    className="remove mr-6 text-3xl text-white font-bold"
                    onClick={() => removeTagFromFilters(filter)}
                  >
                    Ã—
                  </span>
                </div>
              ))}
            </div>
            <div>
              <button className="clear font-bold" onClick={clearFilters}>
                Clear
              </button>
            </div>
          </div>
        )}
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  :root {
    --primary: #5ba4a4;
    --secondary: #7b8e8e;
    --bgColor: #effafa;
    --filterTable: #eef6f6;
    --dark: #2c3a3a;
    --black: #242424;
    --shadow: #5ba4a42c;
    --mobile: 375px;
    --desktop: 1440px;
  }
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  const filterFunc = ({ role, level, tools, languages }) => {
    if (filters.length === 0) return true;
    const tags = [role, level];
    if (tools) tags.push(...tools);
    if (languages) tags.push(...languages);
    return filters.every((filter) => tags.includes(filter));
  };
};
```
